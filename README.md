## Contributing  
Let me be honest: this is basically a web wrapper around the Unifi UI. I’m relatively new to Swift, so if you spot any mistakes or have issues with the app, feel free to open an issue. Forks and pull requests are also welcome – contributions to improve the project are highly appreciated!
